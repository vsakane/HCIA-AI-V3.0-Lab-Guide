#Data preparation
'''
10 data were randomly set, and the data were in a linear relationship.
The data is converted to array format so that it can be computed directly when
multiplication and addition are used.

#Import the required modules, numpy for calculation, and Matplotlib for drawing
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#This code is for jupyter Notebook only
#%matplotlib inline
# define data, and change list to array
