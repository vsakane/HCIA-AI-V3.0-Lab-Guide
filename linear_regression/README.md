# Detail of linear regression
### About This Experiment
This experiment mainly uses basic Python code and the simplest data to reproduce how a
linear regression algorithm iterates and fits the existing data distribution step by step.
The experiment mainly used Numpy module and Matplotlib module.Numpy for calculation,
Matplotlib for drawing.
### Objectives
The main purpose of this experiment is as follows.
- Familiar with basic Python statements
- Master the implementation steps of linear regression
### Thinking and practice
1. Try to modify the original data yourself, Think about it: Does the loss value have to go to
zero?
2. Modify the values of Lr, Think: What is the role of the Lr parameter?
